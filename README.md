# Conor O'Riordan's Portfolio

Please view my portfolio website made with the Vue JS framework and utilizing the Bulma CSS framework.
On the site, there are several demo videos available showcasing several projects I have done in recent months.
Naturally, each project as a github repo for you to peruse at your leisure.
